# 100_Days_Project-Challange

In this project you have to pick bunch of challanges. Or the things you want to do. You can think it as a to-be list. 
After creating to be list. You have have to pick one skill. A skill can have one out of three diffculty level, that can be 'Easy', 'Medium' & 'Hard'. There is nothing impossible. Even Impossible says I-AM-POSSIBLE. For labeling the the skill's levels, you can use by, if a skill takes 1-2 days you can say it's 'Easy'. for 'Medium' 5-6 days and for 'Hard' 9-10 days. You should try not to give one skill more than 10 days because 10 days are more than enough for learning one skill. 
You have to choose 1st skill you want to learn, after completing that you can jump on to another. You can use Youtube, Medium Blogs, Free Courses, Data Camp etc. These are some which I have in my mind you can add or make a list of it. So others can have some idea.

If you are wondering how I know all these Rich Armstrong from Skillshare is the person I learn from. He has made this movie for us for doing 100 Days Porject. But the Ideas here is some diffrent. You can go watch it if you like. Here we are doing diffrent skills frequently. We will not take one skill and do it for 100 days as we are technical peoples we have to jump on to the diffrenct things for the organization or your organization. If you are not a technical person that's okay. You will use the same techniques as we all are. So you are not diffrent from others. 

## Tips 
For tips I will try to give few tips in the Tips Page. These tips will be from the diffrent books, videos, blog or experience. 
I will not garuntee you that these tips will work for you. May be tips may work for me not for you, not for me but works for you. 
So you can add your own tips. 

## Steps
A. Take a skill 
B. Give it a diffculty level tag
C. Start learning that skill from the Platform of your choice (Platform will help you guide, if you start learning your own it will take imerse time)

## Using the git repo

## Rules
1. You have to declare the skill on any social media platform
2. Nominate your friends to do the same, because it motivated you. Have a friend with some challange will motivates you when you are tired. You motivated them when they are tired. (If you don't have any one, within few days we might make some community of such people who are doing the same, ping me if you want that)
3. No day Missed, If you miss a day just don't count that that and the day before
4. Add your rules if we like that we will add them
